### Amazing Minesweeper
You've inherited minesweeper written by some other developer. It's playable, but very raw.

##### Long term goal:
- have UI/feature-set/game-logic similar to [MS-Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper)
- have codebase that you can proudly push to your public git repo 

##### Short term goal (for the interview):
- have a backlog with the tasks
- close the most critical ones 

##### Suggestions:
- run it and play 
- understand how it works
- find bugs, missing features and places you want to rewrite
- prepare backlog for your next steps (short task summary is enough)
- prioritise it as you wish
- start working on it keeping in mind you have 1h30m for everything

### Good luck!
- [your backlog](BACKLOG.md)
